# Simplify mlops for everyone

Simplify ML Ops for Every one

## Challenges

Idea here is to simplify MLOps for every one. In the recent years XOps has become very promising but with that there is also the challenging of many tools and many patterns.
With open source and also cloud tools how are can we simplify the entire process

- Training process
- Inferencing process
- Model scoring performance management
- Model REST API management
- Model training performance management
- Code repo
- Code versioning and branching standards
- Feature store
- Data drift
- model feature share
- model share
- feature store data governance
- PII and sensitivite data management
- Responsible AI i mlops
- Testing and validating
- MLOps team RACI
- Security in MLOps
- Access control management
- MLOps onboarding process and tools
- MLOps automated deployments
- MLOps Model environment management
- Audit and compliance capability
- Scale
  - CPU
  - GPU
  - FPGA
  - Quantum  
- Agility
